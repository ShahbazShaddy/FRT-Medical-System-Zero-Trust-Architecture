        <h3>Functional Reach Test (FRT) - Help & FAQ</h3>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>1. What is the Functional Reach Test (FRT)?</h4>
            <p>The Functional Reach Test (FRT) is a quick and simple clinical tool designed to assess dynamic balance and fall risk in elderly and frail adults. It measures how far a person can reach forward without moving their feet, helping predict the likelihood of falls.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>2. Who should perform the FRT?</h4>
            <p>The FRT is primarily intended for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Older adults in the community or clinical settings.</li>
                <li>Frail adults who are at risk of falling.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>3. How is the Functional Reach Test performed?</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand close to a wall without touching it.</li>
                <li>Raise the arm closest to the wall at shoulder height (90° flexion) with a closed fist.</li>
                <li>Measure the starting position of the 3rd metacarpal head (knuckle).</li>
                <li>Reach as far forward as possible without moving your feet or losing balance.</li>
                <li>Measure the end position of the 3rd metacarpal head.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The difference between start and end points is the reach distance. Three trials are done, and the average of the last two is used for scoring.</p>
